# connectN
- Connect-n is like Connect-4 but the size of the board and the number of pieces in a row needed to win are user parameters!
- Each player takes a turn dropping one of their pieces into a column.
- Pieces land on top of pieces already played in that column.
- Each player is trying to get n pieces in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
- The game ends if either player gets n pieces in a row or the board becomes full.

## Installation
